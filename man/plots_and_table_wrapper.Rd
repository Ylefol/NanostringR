\usage{
plots_and_table_wrapper(
  res_list,
  samp_sheet,
  norm_counts,
  target_genes,
  save_loc
)
}
\arguments{
\item{res_list}{The list returned by \code{analysis_with_geneset}, containing
\code{results_df} with geoscores and per-gene expression.}

\item{samp_sheet}{A sample sheet data frame with columns Sample, Group, and Lane.}

\item{norm_counts}{A gene x sample matrix of normalized counts with lane IDs as
column names.}

\item{target_genes}{Character vector of genes to display in the summary table.}

\item{save_loc}{Path to the directory where per-patient plots will be saved.}
}
\value{
Called for its side effects. Prints one combined plot per patient to the active
device and saves each as a PNG file named by patient ID in \code{save_loc}.
Also prints control quantile values to the console.
}
\description{
Generates a per-patient clinical report combining a quantile plot and a gene
expression summary table. For each patient, the geoscore is plotted against
control-derived quantile bands, and a table of per-gene normalized counts is
shown alongside. Multi-timepoint patients are handled automatically. Plots are
both printed to the active device (for RMarkdown rendering) and saved to disk.
