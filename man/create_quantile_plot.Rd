\usage{
create_quantile_plot(plot_dta, quantiles)
}
\arguments{
\item{plot_dta}{A data frame containing columns \code{geoscore_ISG}, \code{Group},
\code{Sample}, and \code{timepoint}. Should include all controls and the target
patient's rows.}

\item{quantiles}{A named numeric vector of five quantile values (0\%, 25\%, 50\%,
75\%, 100\%) derived from the control group, as returned by \code{quantile()}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object. Print or pass to \code{grid.arrange()} for rendering.

\description{
Creates a ggplot2 visualization showing a patient's geoscore trajectory plotted
against control-derived quantile reference bands (0-25, 25-50, 50-75, 75-100
percentiles). Controls are shown as a filled background; patient samples are
shown as labeled points, connected by a line when multiple timepoints exist.
