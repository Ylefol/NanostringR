\usage{
QC_plus_RUV_processing(guide_vect, ref_name, remove_failed_HK = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{guide_vect}{A named character vector where values are RCC file paths
(including the path) and names are the group label for each file.}

\item{ref_name}{The group name to be used as the reference/control.}

\item{remove_failed_HK}{Boolean indicating if housekeeping genes correlating
with the condition should be removed from the downstream analysis. By default
it is set to FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{set}: A SeqExpressionSet with raw counts and RUV-estimated
    unwanted variance factors in the phenotype data.
  \item \code{vsd}: A DESeqTransform object with variance-stabilized,
    batch-corrected expression values. Use \code{assay(vsd)} to extract
    the normalized count matrix.
}
}
\description{
This function reads in RCC (nanostring) files, performs a set of quality controls,
and finally processed the data using RUV (Remove Unwanted Variance).
Depending on the parameter settings the function will also remove/filter out
housekeeping genes which are found to correlate with the condition.
