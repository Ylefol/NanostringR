\usage{
plot_PCA(normalized_counts, QCdata, n_genes = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{normalized_counts}{A gene x sample matrix of normalized counts with sample
IDs as column names.}

\item{QCdata}{A data frame of QC metrics as returned by
\code{QC_plus_nSolver_processing} or \code{QC_plus_RUV_processing}, with
sample IDs as row names and a \code{Group} column.}

\item{n_genes}{Integer. Number of top most-variable genes to use for PCA.
Defaults to 500; if fewer genes are available all genes are used.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing PC1 vs PC2 with percentage variance explained on each
axis and samples labeled by sample ID.
}
\description{
Creates a PCA plot from a normalized count matrix. Counts are log2-transformed
(pseudocount of 1 added), and PCA is computed on the top most-variable genes.
Samples are labeled and colored by group.
