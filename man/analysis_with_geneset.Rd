analysis_with_geneset(
  main_data,
  target_genes,
  sample_data,
  group_name = "",
  save_loc = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{main_data}{A gene x sample matrix of normalized counts with lane IDs as
column names.}

\item{target_genes}{Character vector of gene names defining the gene set.}

\item{sample_data}{A sample sheet data frame with columns Sample, Group, and Lane.}

\item{group_name}{Character string used as the gene set label in the plot title.
Defaults to an empty string.}

\item{save_loc}{Path to the directory where the summary boxplot will be saved.
Defaults to the working directory.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{boxplot}: A ggplot2 boxplot of per-sample expression for the gene set.
  \item \code{results_df}: A data frame with the geoscore as the first row followed
    by per-gene normalized expression. Genes not found in the data appear as NA rows.
}
}
\description{
Computes a geometric mean expression score (geoscore) for a defined gene set
and generates a per-sample boxplot comparing patient and control groups.
Genes absent from the data are reported and included as NA rows in the output.
