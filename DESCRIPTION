Title: Quality Control and Normalization for NanoString Gene Expression Data
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Yohan", "Lefol", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "yohan.lefol@gmail.com")
Description: Provides quality control and normalization tools for NanoString nCounter
    gene expression data, following the guidelines described in Bhattacharya et al.
    (2021) <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32789507/>. This package consolidates
    two packages that are no longer actively maintained: NanoStringNorm (Waggott et
    al., 2012, <https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3356845/>) and
    NanoStringQCPro (Bioconductor). Their source code is included verbatim and all
    credit for those contributions belongs to the original authors. Custom functions
    built on top of these support clinical reporting workflows, including RUV-based
    normalization and nSolver-equivalent normalization for longitudinal sample
    analysis.
